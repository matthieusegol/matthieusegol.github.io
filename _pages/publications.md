## Mandatory Central Clearing and Banks' Use of Interest Rate Derivatives (with [S. Daudignon](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/daudignon-sandra/))


In this paper we investigate the impact of the US central clearing requirement on banks’
use of interest rate derivatives. We document that despite the mandatory clearing of
interest rate swaps, there is still a significant share of banks with a limited clearing
activity, several years after the implementation of the reform. We provide robust evidence
that this can be explained by a portfolio rebalancing of banks for which central
clearing would represent a substantial cost. More specifically, these institutions substituted
mandated instruments, i.e. swaps, with over-the-counter interest rate options,
which are not yet mandated to be centrally cleared. While the portfolio composition
is impacted, the amount of hedging is not, which is important from a regulator’s perspective
given the objective to not impede hedging. Lastly, we show that the subsequent
introduction of relatively tighter capital requirements for uncleared products
did not translate into comparatively higher capital charges for banks that rebalanced
their portfolio. These results suggest that for a significant number of institutions, the
post-crisis reform package does not provide a cost incentive to move towards central
clearing yet.
