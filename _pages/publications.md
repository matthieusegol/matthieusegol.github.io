<!-- ## Mandatory Central Clearing and Banks' Use of Interest Rate Derivatives (with [S. Daudignon](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/daudignon-sandra/))

 In this paper we investigate the impact of the US central clearing requirement on banks' use of interest rate derivatives. We document that despite the mandatory clearing of interest rate swaps, there is still a significant share of end-user banks with a limited clearing activity, several years after the implementation of the reform. We show this stems from the fact that these institutions substituted mandated instruments, i.e. swaps, with over-the-counter interest rate options, which are not yet mandated to be centrally cleared. We also provide evidence that the subsequent introduction of relatively tighter capital requirements for uncleared products through Basel III did not translate into comparatively higher capital charges for banks that rebalanced their portfolio. These results suggest that for a significant number of institutions, the post-crisis reform package does not provide a cost incentive to move towards central clearing yet. -->
 
## The Impact of Bank Loan Terms on Intangible Investment in Europe (with A. Kolev and L. Maurin)


[Download paper here](http://matthieusegol.github.io/files/Segol_Kolev_Maurin_2020.pdf)

Using European firm-level data from a new survey, we document the impact of bank loan terms on investment in intangible assets of non-financial corporations. We show that quantity rationing (i.e. granting loans of smaller size than requested) is the main factor hindering borrowers' propensity to invest in intangible assets. Provided that firms are satisfied with their loan size; unfavorable rate, maturity and collateral requirements have no significant effects on the probability to invest in intangible assets. However, these terms do have a negative impact on the probability to invest in multiple intangibles simultaneously. Hence, inadequate loan terms, other than the size, undermine the possibility for firms to benefit from the complementarities of these assets (e.g. R\&D and training), which have been shown to be critical for firms' productivity.

## Asset Prices with Ambiguity Aversion and Collateral Constraint

This paper studies the impact of an occasionally binding collateral constraint on
asset prices when agents have heterogeneous ambiguity aversion. The results show
that the constraint can lead to lower stock return volatility, suggesting a possible stabilizing
effect of tighter financial regulations when market participants are concerned
about ambiguity. Simulations also suggest that a binding constraint can speed up the
disappearance of ambiguity-averse agents by leading them to have more pessimistic
beliefs and to save relatively less. Through this channel, the constraint can contribute
to reduced asset mispricing in the long run. -->
